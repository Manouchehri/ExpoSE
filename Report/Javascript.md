## 2.1 History of Symbolic Execution

Symbolic execution is a technique for testing program correctness initially proposed in the 1970s. Classically, it's the process of executing a program by representing its variables as arbitrary symbols rather than concrete values. Execution of the program occurs using these symbolic inputs by extending the basic operators and semantics of the program's language to use symbols and produce symbolic formulas rather than concrete values. In doing so, each symbolic execution tests many actual instances of execution. If statements, and language features that cause execution to diverge, are represented as a branch condition, a conjunction of conditions on symbols that must be satisfied. Evaluating the constraint allows you to identify whether a path is feasible and if so, the satisfied constraint provides the set of concrete inputs that the path could be run under[^1].  In the trivial case, if only one path is feasible, then execution occurs down that path. In the case where both paths are feasible, then parallel execution occurs, which causes the program state to diverge. At the end of execution the path condition, the conjunction of branch conditions taken to the current point of execution, provides a unique representation of a path tested through the program and when solved using a constraint solver produces a set of inputs that when run take the same path through the program as the symbolic execution [^3][^39]. By exploring a program's paths exhaustively (or as thoroughly as possible within either a time or path count constraint) combining symbolic execution with techniques to compare symbolic output with expected values it's possible to test program correctness. [^31]

For example, consider the program below which returns the sum of the absolute values of two values. There are four possible paths that can be taken through the program. The first is where neither if branches are entered, the second is where the value of `x` is less than zero, the third is where the value of `y` is less than zero, and the fourth is where both `x` and `y` is less than zero. Symbolic execution would explore each of these paths and produce concrete values for each path.

```javascript
1 function abs_sum (x, y){
2  if (x < 0)
3    x = x * -1
4  if (y < 0)
5    y = y * -1
6  return x + y
7 }
```

Historically, this technique has been impractical due to the limitations on computing resources and the capabilities of automated theorem provers[^31] however in the 2000s there was a a number of advancements in the technique by DART, EXE, and Microsoft's SAGE, made feasible due to the improvements in computer hardware and the improvement of solvers[^35][^38].

In these modern implementations, the program is run both concretely and symbolically in so called concolic execution. In concolic execution, the program is instrumented to run concretely whilst the program state is shadowed by symbolic variables allowing the concrete execution to 'drive' the symbolic execution. Unlike pure symbolic execution, concolic execution requires its initial input to be concrete, this input can be random or crafted to fit the target program[^34][^39]. As concolic execution concretely executes programs, rather than just modelling the semantics of the language you can be sure that any bugs found are actual bugs. Additionally, when a constraint cannot be solved concolic execution allows concrete values to be substituted for unsolvable elements of constraints[^36][^37].

## 2.2 Limitations 

### 2.2.1 Finding and Choosing Paths

Although in theory symbolic execution will exhaustively search through all feasible paths, as the complexity of the program under test increases the number of paths in the program increases roughly exponentially[^39]. As these symbolic execution tools are bounded by real world time constraint, paths must be chosen carefully in order to prioritise exploring 'interesting' cases in the time available.

In EXE, and other more traditional methods, paths are found by building a control flow graph and then exploring the graph using a form of breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search base. Neither BFS or DFS are particularly well suited for the problem, DFS is especially flawed due to its ability to get 'stuck' in a symbolically bounded loop [^35]. 

DART and SAGE, by contrast, uses a directed search strategy. Following the initial input, paths are generated by repeated negating the conditions in the path condition that was explored. Then paths are prioritised using a priority queue [^33].

In detail the algorithm for finding new test inputs is as follows, starting with an initial input *i* which has an attribute, _bound_ of 0, and a priority queue _pq_ the program executes symbolically and returns the path condition for its execution, _pc_, in the form of a sequence of predicates _c~1~ ^ c~2~ ^ ... c~n~_.  To explore alternatives to the branches that were chosen in the last execution, for _j = i.bound ... n_ where _n_ is the number of predicates in _pc_,  new inputs are generated by negating the _c~j~_ and solving the new constraint [^33][^34].  Each new input is pushed to _pq_ with a bound of _j_.  _bound_ is used to prevent path conditions being explored multiple times. The paths in the priority queue can then be prioritised using a chosen heuristic [^39]. 

### 2.2.2 Constraint Solving

Constraint solvers are used for two purposes in symbolic execution: determining the satisfiability of branch/path constraints and producing concrete input for satisfiable conditions. Despite continual improvements in the performance of constraint solvers, calls to solvers are typically the bottleneck is symbolic execution - fortunately there are a number of possible optimisations that can be done to reduce the burden on constraint solvers and achieve better performance [^39].

##Caching

Frequently constraints will need to be solved multiple times throughout the course of execution. Instead of calling the constraint solver multiple times for the same constraint, satisfying results can be stored in a map of constraints to satisfying results. Then, instead of directly calling the constraint solver directly, a cache lookup can be performed first to see if there is a satisfying result [^40].

This caching process can be extended to evaluate the strength of formulas. If there is a satisfying result for a stronger constraint than the one being queried then that satisfying result will be valid for the weak constraint. For instance, if the cache contains the following mapping `(x > 3 ^ y < 1) ^ x < 10 -> {x: 5, y: -214} ` then the satisfying result will be valid for the condition `x > 3 ^ y < 1`. This caching scheme can also be used to cache unsatisfiable constraints [^40].

### Removing Redundant Constraints

The majority of queries to the constraint solver in concolic execution are to determine the feasibility of a given branch. In most cases a branch's condition will not depend on all of the variables in a path constraint allowing redundant constraints to be eliminated before passing the constraint to constraint solver. Although if this technique is applied the constraint solver will only return satisfiable values for non-eliminated variables, the existing concrete values of the other variables can be used to produce a full set inputs [^39].

For instance, consider the following function.

```javascript
function unlikely_function (x, y, z){
 if (x < 0)
   x--
 if (z > 5)
   z++
 if (y < 13)
   y++
 if (y + x > 15)
   y = y * x
 return x + y + z
}
```

If the existing path constraint is (_x_ < 0) ^ (_z_ > 5) ^ (_y_ < 13) ^ (_y_ + _x_ > 15) and I'm negating the last path condition to explore a new path:   (_x_ < 0) ^ (_z_ > 5) ^ (_y_ < 13) ^ Â¬(_y_ + _x_ > 15) then the _z_ > 5 constraint can be eliminated as _z_ does not influence the _y_ + _x_ > 15 branch.

## 2.3 Symbolic Execution for Bug Detection

Symbolic execution can be used for a variety of purposes, for instance: generating test inputs, finding infeasible paths,  finding equivalent (and therefore redundant code) but its typical application, and the focus of this project, is bug detection. 

In classical symbolic execution, as no actual code is executed bugs must be detected through the use of logical assertions that are tested by the constraint solver.  EFFIGY, described in [^31] uses the concept an input predicate and an output predicate to determine program correctness, if for all inputs which satisfy the input predicate also satisfy the output predicate then the program is said to be correct. These are implemented through the use of `ASSERT`, `ASSUME`, and `PROVE` statements.  In modern symbolic execution tools such as DART, rather than having to add additional assertions bugs are detected when runtime exceptions occur [^33].

Symbolic execution offers a number advantages over typical testing techniques. Unit and integration testing are expensive and require a large amount of effort to reach 100% coverage. In addition, they require a large amount of mock and driver code to be written, often exceeding the size of the program under test. Unit testing and integration often miss 'corner case' bugs, which are not considered either when the program is developed or when the system is tested.

Static analysis is much cheaper to run but at the cost of precision. Static analysis often produces false reports and consequently also requires a large amount of time spent to identify actual faults. Static analysis often may struggle to identify subtle bugs due to the lack of information available outside of runtime, and will typically perform worse on weakly typed languages.

Symbolic execution, like static analysis, requires no additional effort on the part of the developer and has the advantage of not producing false positives and providing a valid test case for each bug found. Symbolic execution is also effective at finding edge case bugs and can also effectively analyse the behaviour of a program when it interacts with libraries.â

# 4. Overview of JavaScript

JavaScript was initially created by a team at Netscape in 1996 with the goal of bringing interactivity to the web via a scripting language. According to Brendan Eich (the creator of JavaScript), up to this point the web was "static, text-heavy, with at best images in tables or floating on the right or left"[^2]. 

When Brendan was initially recruited by Netscape he was recruited with the aim of implementing Scheme, a dialect of Lisp that supports first-class functions [^17], in the browser however by this time Sun and Netscape were negotiating to bring Java to Netscape Navigator[^16]. An internal debate occurred about the need for two languages but Eich and other influential developers at both Sun and Netscape believed that the two languages would serve different audiences. 'Professional' developers would veer towards Java for building logic heavy components and designers and amateurs would use the scripting language as a "glue" for joining together components[^2].

Despite targeting a different audience Mocha, the language that would later evolve into JavaScript, was required by management to "look like Java", according to Eich, ruling out the existing languages Perl, Python, and Scheme. Eventually Eich settled on "Scheme-ish first-class functions and Self-ish (albeit singular) prototypes as the main ingredients" [^16]. Mocha also inherited a number of confusing Java language features such as the distinction between primitives and objects (e.g. `string` vs. `String` ) and the `Date` constructor which is a port of Java's `java.util.Date`, complete with the Y2K bug [^19]. Perl and Python are also credited to influencing Mocha's string handling and regular expressions and AWK inspired the use of the `function` keyword [^18]. The first version of the language had an incredibly short development period, Eich claims he spent "about ten days" developing the first JavaScript interpreter[^2].

After JavaScript (abandoning its previous names, Mocha and LiveScript) was released in Netscape Navigator 2 Microsoft began work on JScript, an equivalent language which shipped with Internet Explorer 3. Eich says that "At some point in late summer or early fall 1996, it became clear to me that JS was going to be standardized. Bill Gates was bitching about us changing JS all the time."[^20], which lead to JavaScript being standardised by Ecma International, an industry group that produces information standards, as ECMAScript in 1997. Since 1997 ECMAScript, now in its sixth version, has also been adopted as an ISO/IEC standard[^21].

A key moment in JavaScript's history occurred in when web developers became fascinated with Ajax, a set of techniques and technologies for making interactive websites, popularised by Google Suggest and Google Maps, spurring on an advancement in interactivity of modern websites [^22]. To alleviate the pain of manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), the hierarchy of objects that make up a HTML web page, and to deal with the problem that  'writing JavaScript should be fun' jQuery was released in 2006[^23] and commanded immediate popularity. In 2007, large tech companies including Digg, Google, Intel, Amazon, and the BBC all reported using jQuery [^23] and in the 12 months between Sept 2007 and 2008 jquery.com received 13.5 million unique visitors[^24]. As early as 2006 it's clear that although JavaScript is a powerful and popular language, in part due to it's low barrier of entry and its unique place as the default language of the web, there are frustrations with the difficulty in reasoning about and writing JavaScript.

Google Chrome launched in 2008, with a new open source JavaScript engine named V8. When it launched V8 initially outperformed other browsers JavaScript engines on benchmarks[^25] in part due to its hidden classes, which reduces the cost of looking up properties on objects that share prototypes via inline caching, its use of a just-in time compiler (JIT) to produce assembly code rather than running an interpreter, as well as its efficient memory management [^26][^27]. The launch of the V8 engine created a so called 'browser war' during which the performance of JavaScript vastly increased across all browsers [^28].

In 2009, Node.js was launched - a JavaScript runtime based on V8 used to build asynchronous applications, popularising JavaScript as a language outside of the browser. Node.js was quickly adopted, with production applications at companies such as Uber and LinkedIn rolling out by 2011[^29][^30]. 

Due in part to popularity of Node, JavaScript is now one of the most popular languages for software development[^4][^5] with npm, Node's package manager, hosting over 475,000 packages[^15].

# 4.1 JavaScript Design

Despite its popularity, writing correct JavaScript code remains a relatively difficult problem due largely to its dynamic type system, its tendency to silently fail, and a number of quirks inherited from early versions of the language as a result of its short development cycle. Additionally, there are a number of inconsistencies in the EMCAScript standard itself which cause interpreter implementations to differ in their approach leading to unspecified behaviours. [^10] Below I'll briefly outline the semantics of JavaScript, including arrays which are the focus of this project, and the different approaches taken to analysing JavaScript code to ensure correctness.

## 4.1.1 Type System

| Type      | Details                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Undefined | The type of variables before they are assigned a value. |
| Null      | The type of the assignable singleton value `null` |
| Boolean   | A standard representation of true and false |
| String    | An ordered sequence of zero or more 16-bit unsigned integers, these are intended to represent UTF-16 characters but are not required to be |
| Number    | Represents the IEE 754 double precision numbers in the range 2 ^-253^ to 2 ^253^ as well as the special cases NaN, $\infty$ , and $ -\infty$. JavaScript's implementation of numbers includes both a positive and negative 0. Whilst most languages have multiple representations of numbers (typically split into integers and floating point numbers) all JavaScript numbers are floating point |
| Object    | Represents a collection of properties, each of which has a name and a value, as well as optionally a setter and/or getter function used to manipulate the value. To a first approximation, Objects can be thought of as a hash map |

JavaScript has six types that variables can be [^8] but the types of variables are not explicitly declared at compile time. Instead, types are dynamic and can change over the course of a program. Consider the program below.

```javascript
let foo = '1';
foo = foo * 2
foo
< 2
```

Initially `foo` is of type string but the type is implicitly coerced into a number by the `*` operator. Coercion between types occurs when the type of an operand is not the type the operator is expecting. For instance, as shown in the example above the `*` operator coerces all operands to numbers. This coercion is a source of error in programs as inputs of an invalid type can be coerced in unexpected ways.

Consider the contrived example below where the input to a function expecting an integer is instead a string. In this case the `+` operator coerces a number to a string resulting in a concatenation rather than an addition.

```javascript
function increment (x) {
  return x + 1
}

let a = '1'
let b = increment(y)
b
< 11
```

Although the previous examples have used strings and numbers, type coercion extends to booleans as well. Non-boolean expressions are coerced with the following rules `undefined`, `null`, `false`, the empty string, `NaN`, `+0`, and `-0` return false while `true`, all other numbers, all other strings, and all Objects return true [^8]. These coercion rules, whilst a common source of error, can be taken advantage of to allow shortcuts like `if (x)` to check for both undefined and null values.

JavaScript also has some idiosyncrasies for testing equality which are underpinned by its type system. There are two operators for testing equality, `==` and `===`.  The `==` operator, the 'standard' equality operator, uses coercion to test the equality of values of differing types. However the standard equality operator doesn't necessarily use the same coercion rules as other operators. For instance, whilst boolean coercion would typically any non-zero and non-NaN number to true  `5 == true` is false. This inconsistency also extends to strings, typically all non-empty strings would coerce to true but `'3' == 1` is false. Additionally, if you compare an object to any other type standard equality converts the object to a primitive which can lead to some unexpected results such as `['7'] == 7`  being true. The strict operator, `===`, by comparison has much saner behaviour - any two values not of the same type are not equal.

## 4.1.2 Objects and Prototypical Inheritance

Typical object-oriented languages define classes which guarantee the exact sets of fields and methods an instance of the class will possess. Instances of the class can be thought of as clones or replicas of the class which mimic the class' behaviour. JavaScript instead uses prototypical inheritance, in which objects have a template or prototype which define a set of properties an object has, but objects are also free to declare their own set of properties and even overwrite their prototype's properties. 

Consider the example below, in which we create a prototype, define a new object of that prototype, and then overwrite one of the values of the prototype.

```javascript
// This is a constructor, color and weight will be values that belong the constructed object
function Fruit (color, weight) {
  this.color = color
  this.weight = weight
}

// This is the set of values all fruit will inherit from the prototype
Fruit.prototype = {
  print: function () {
    console.log(`Color: ${this.color} Weight: ${this.weight}`)
  }
}

var orange = new Fruit('orange', 100)
orange instanceof Fruit // orange.prototype === Fruit.prototype
< true
orange.print()
< Color: orange Weight: 100

// hasOwnProperty checks whether a property belongs to the object or to its prototype
orange.hasOwnProperty('color') 
< true
orange.hasOwnProperty('print') // print is inherited from orange.prototype
< false
orange.print = () => console.log('A Orange')
orange.print()
< A Orange
orange.hasOwnProperty('print') // print is now defined in orange as well
< true
```

 A prototype may itself have a prototype, the sequence of prototypes which define the properties of a given object are referred to as a prototype chain[^8][^9].  By default, all created objects inherit from `Object.prototype` and functions, as a special class of object, inherit from `Function.prototype` which inherits from `Object.prototype`. These prototypes are part of the EMCAScript standard and provide utilities to make working with objects of that prototype easier. For example, `Object.prototype` provides functions for iterating over all the values of an object or all the keys in the object.

Consider the prototype chain of the example below.

````javascript
function Food (calories, portions) {
  this.calories = calories
  this.portionsPerDay = portions
}

Food.prototype = {
	caloriesPerDay: function () {
		return this.calories * this.portionsPerDay
	}
}

function Fruit (color, weight, calories, portions) {
  Food.call(this, calories, portions) // Call the food constructor
  this.color = color
  this.weight = weight
}

// The prototype of Fruit is Food, but we want to use the Fruit constructor
Fruit.prototype = Object.create(Food.prototype);
Fruit.prototype.constructor = Fruit;

// Let's add our print function to the Fruit prototype
Fruit.prototype.print = function () {
  console.log(`Color: ${this.color} Weight: ${this.weight}`)
}

let orange = new Fruit('orange', 100, 47, 5)
orange.print()
< Color: orange Weight: 100
orange.caloriesPerDay()
< 235
orange instanceof Fruit
< true
orange instanceof Food
< true
orange instanceof Object
< true
````

In the example above we have a prototype chain length of three. Our `orange` object has a prototype of `Fruit`, which has a prototype of `Food`, which has a prototype of `Object` .

## 4.1.3 Arrays

Unlike other languages, JavaScript does not model arrays as continuously indexed tuples. Instead arrays are  a special form of object where array elements are properties that satisfy the following test for a key `k`, `ToString(ToUint32(k)) === k && ToUint32(k) !== 2^32 - 1`. Put more simply, an array is a special case of an object where the array elements are any value where the property can be coerced to a a positive integer number less than 2^32^ - 1. These array elements are treated differently to regular properties by array prototypes and the length property. 

The length of an array is a property of the array prototype which tracks the highest index in the array. Note, that the highest index of the array does not necessarily track the number of elements in the array as arrays do not enforce any kind of ordering on their properties making it possible to create a non-contiguous array, an array with 'holes' in it, as shown in the example below. The length product is not read-only as you might expect. If you increase the, the length empty elements will be added to the end of the array and decreasing the length will truncate the array to satisfy the new length.

```javascript
let arr = [] // an empty array
arr[0] = 0
arr[2] = 2
arr
< [0, , 2]
arr.length 
< 3
```

Another by-product of arrays being special form of object is that arrays are not homogenously typed. Whilst most languages require arrays to only hold values of a single type, JavaScript objects and by extension arrays can contain multiple types of value as shown by the following example `let array = ['a', 2.0, {}, new Fruit()]` . 

As described to above, arrays can have both properties and array elements. If the property fails the array element test described above, then the value is stored as a regular object value. This can lead to subtle bugs when working with numbers if bounds are not checked as values smaller than 0 and greater than 2^32^ - 1 will not be stored as an array element, as demonstrated below.

```javascript
let arr = []
arr[0] = 'foo' // array element
arr.length
> 1
arr[4294967296] = 'bar' // 4294967296 === 2^32-1, property not an element
arr[-1] = 'baz' // -1 < 0, property not an element
arr.length
> 1
arr[4294967296]
> 'bar'
arr[-1]
> 'baz'
```

### Prototype Methods

The array prototype has a large number of helper functions that are frequently taken advantage of by developers, a number of which were added in the latest version of the EMCAScript standard [^8]. Below are some of the more commonly used and interesting functions.

| Function Name | Signature                           | Description                              |
| ------------- | :---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| indexOf       | `indexOf(element)`                  | Returns the first index of the array that contains `element` or  -1 if `element` is not in the array |
| lastIndexOf   | `lastIndexOf(element) `             | Returns the last index of the array that contains `element` or -1 if element is not in the array |
| slice         | `slice(begin, end)`                 | Returns a copy of the array with the elements from the index `begin` up to the `end` index. If `end` is not provided it will slice from `begin` to the last element of the array |
| push          | `push(element) `                    | Increases the length of the array by one and adds `element` to the end of the array |
| pop           | `pop()`                             | Removes the last element in the array and returns it |
| unShift       | `unShift(elementA, elementB, ...) ` | Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length |
| includes      | `includes(element, startIndex)`     | Returns true if the array contains element either starting from `startIndex` or the start of the array if no` startIndex` is provided |
| reverse       | `reverse()`                         | Reverses the array in place and returns a reference to the array |
| forEach       | `forEach(func) `                    | Calls `func` on each element in the array. Calls `func` with `(value, index, array)` |
| filter        | `filter(func)`                      | Returns a new array that contains elements that return true when `func` is called on them. `func` is called with `currentElement` |
| map           | `map(func)`                         | Returns a new array with the results of calling `func` on each element in the array. `func` is called with `(value, index, array)` |
| reduce        | `reduce(func, initialValue)`        | Calls `func(accumulator, value, index, array)` on every element in the array and returns the value of accumulator. If `initialValue` is provided then the first time `func` is called then `accumulator` is set to the value of `initialValue` |
| some          | `some(func)`                        | Calls `func(element, index, array)` for every element in the array. Returns true if `func` returns true for at least one element in the array |
| every         | `every(func)`                       | Calls ` func(element, index, array)` for every element in the array. Returns true if `func` returns true for all elements in the array |

# 4.2 Ensuring the Correctness of JavaScript 

As described in 1.1, assuring the correctness of JavaScript code is an unsolved problem - in part due to the fact JavaScript is a dynamically typed scripting language but also due to legacy design decisions. Efforts have been made to make the language itself safer to use, ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode (later made the default mode in ECMAScript 6) which restricts the use of certain language features and also defines additional circumstances that exceptions should be thrown in but there are still many errors that can occur even within the safer subset of JavaScript.

Tools like Eslint and Flow are commonly used by developers to statically analyse code and identify bugs but are limited in their scope. Eslint uses a narrow set of rules to identify possibly dangerous behaviour and Flow is constrained to reasoning about types and in some cases requires additional annotating of code to allow Flow to identify possible errors. These limited set of warnings don't fully reflect the dynamic nature of JavaScript and the subtle interactions that can occur due to prototypical inheritance, dynamic property access, and dynamic dispatch. There have been an number of attempts to analyse JavaScript statically however most approaches fall short of useful due to their inability to reason about functions like `call()` and `apply()` [^11] with the best results requiring an element of dynamic analysis as well. [^12] [^13]

Consequently there has been a shift in interest towards analysing safer (and less dynamic) targets which compile to JavaScript, the most popular of which is Typescript. Typescript is a superset of ECMAScript 6 which includes optional types to enable errors to be caught statically before compilation. Although TypeScript makes it easier to reason about potential errors caused by coercion, TypeScript itself provides no guarantees of static soundness - it's still possible for a TypeScript program to compile to JavaScript successfully and encounter a run-time error as a result of type coercion when executed [^1]. Extensions to TypeScript have been suggested to provide soundness [^7] [^3] although these approaches require a modified interpreter or runtime enforcement. Regardless of soundness or not, whilst TypeScript and its derivatives provide a way of reducing or eliminating type based errors they don't help identify or eliminate errors that occur due to other dynamic features of JavaScript such as prototypical inheritance, dynamic property access, or dynamic dispatch.

There most have been a number of attempts to produce formal semantics for JavaScript, to allow for better reasoning about JavaScript code however no attempts can be considered completely successful. One approach taking by Phillippa Gardner et al. (JaVerT) [^11] [^12] is to translate a subset of the JavaScript language (targeting ECMAScript 5 in strict mode) to an intermediate language, JSL, and then performing analysis on JSL. Although the results of their analysis their translated code is promising, their process and toolchain requires an expert level understanding of the semantics of JavaScript and developers to annotate their code pre and post-conditions. Although, this approach may be suited for smaller programs (or critical subsets of programs) its approach does not scale well to large applications. Other approaches such a KJS [^10] and Î»JS [^14] support even less of the language than JaVerT and crucially none of the three approaches target the ECMAScript 6 specification.

Symbolic execution provides an ideal way to test JavaScript code. By concretely executing the program you avoid having to reason about the dynamic nature of JavaScript and instead defer this to the interpreter. The use of an interpreter for testing also provides flexibility, if you want to test JavaScript in another environment you're able to switch interpreters. Additionally, by using concrete execution to back analysis symbolic execution avoids having to model the entire language specification. Finally, symbolic execution is also able to test any JavaScript underlying library code.

ExpoSE is a tool for symbolic execution of JavaScript. The target program is instrumented with Jalangi2, a tool that provides hooks before and after each statement is executed, which is used to build a symbolic representation of the program. ExpoSE uses a harness to randomly generate inputs for public functions in a target JavaScript program. It then uses a DART[^?] based directed search to attempt to explore all feasible paths in the program up to a maximum path count. Constraints are solved using Z3, a Microsoft Research theorem prover.
